This is repo I created as part of learning TailWind and building resposive components of [ToDesktop](https://www.todesktop.com/) Website  
I am building this website in a incremental way and each folder consists new component along with the previously built components.  
I am using Tailwind CDN so there is no need to install any dependencies. Just fork and go live.

<--------------01------------------>  
Component 1 is the Nav bar which has been made responsive using tailwind breakpoints.  

<--------------02------------------>  
Component 2 is the Hero Section where I have learnt tailwinds active states 

<--------------03------------------>
Componnet 3 is a Scroll slider section with horizontal sroll animation when scrolled on the page
